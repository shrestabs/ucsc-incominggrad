Congratulation  to all graduate students (M.S, Ph.D.) for receiving an admit from University of California, Santa Cruz. I intend to document some of the common Q&As that is likely to arise from the day you get an admit to days well into the 2 quarters of your graduate studies. I write this from an Indian/CS/CE student prespective though its applicable to all grad students. 

There are no answers that will help compare your admits. Post in whatsapp/facebook groups or talk to the previous batch grads for opinions on the same. However my take on the pros and cons of UCSC are,

UCSC Pros
------
* Strong research. High profile Professors and labs.
* Proximity to bay area.
* Small school. Better visibility.
* Funding likely with TA.

UCSC Cons
------
* Less number of Career fair.
* No co-op.
* No spring intake.

Getting started
------
* Join some of these groups. 
1. Official Group of UCSC Students 
2. UC Santa Cruz Class of 2020 Roommates
3. University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Housing, Sublets & Roommates 
4. UCSC Indian Student Association
5. Join UCSC and Santa Cruz Reddit
6. Allgrads google groups (You will get a link/invite on your non UCSC email)
* Request your i20 from the international student's office (ISSS <https://isss.ucsc.edu>). You would get an email about it. You will pay around 70$ to get the i20 couriered to you. You will need it for your Visa. 
* As an international student Keep track of your financial, logisitic requirements at <https://visadocs.ucsc.edu>
* Keep track of your TODOs at <https://my.ucsc.edu/>
* Find housing, decide courses, visa, tickets etc ... 

COURSES
------
- Choosing courses How to?  
> Know your funding. Know your goal for master’s. Know your degree requirement (<https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering/graduate/degree-requirements-cmps>) Know when and where you want to intern. Plan your time accordingly. You are the best judge.
- How many quarters does it take to finish MS?
> Practically at least 3. At most 6. Average is 4. (Sept Joining Year (to) December Joining Year+1)
- How many courses per quarter? 
> At least 2 As a international student to maintain a full-time student status we require 10 credits.So, two 5 credit courses is usual. 3 is pushing it. 4 is impossible. Alternatively 3 + TAing is impossible. The first quarter is an exception. 3 courses is manageable including CMPS200 as one.

- **Bonus question:** How to maintain full-time student status with the college without taking 10 credit course?
> There is a course called independent study/CMPS297. That is a filler 5 credit course that u can take with the permission of a professor and work on your project/thesis. What is expected out of this course depends on which Prof. signed your independent study course. You can even take 2 CMPS297 a quarter and stay a full time student and just do research. You will have to pay the quarters’ full fee though. <https://grad.soe.ucsc.edu/independentstudy>
- When to choose courses?
> You will get a mail from the grad advisor (Alicia Haley). Typically 45 days before beginning of quarter.
- When to take CMPS200/CMPE200? 
> Should be taken in the 1st quarter. See requirements.
- Can CMPE202 Requirement be waived (CS grads only)?
> Yes. With an oral test with one of the CMPE202 Profs. If you fail the test, you need to take the course with Letter grade to get done with the requirement.

GRADES
------
- How important is GPA at UCSC? 
> Until your GPA is > 3.5/4 and you don’t get below B- on 2 courses you are good if your plan is to join the industry. If you intend to pursue a Ph.D a good GPA is necessary. Also, scoring B- on 2 courses will put you on academic probation. Poor Academic Standing for international students can have you deported.

- To take THESIS or PROJECT track(Masters only)?
> You have until the last quarter to decide. You can walk away with any of these choices by enrolling in the courses CMPS(E)296/299 in the graduating quarter. 

VACCINES
------
- How to show proof of immunization? 
> Go to a lab nearby(I went to Dr.Lal PathLabs). Show them the bunch of immunizations proof needed. With 3-4 Blood samples + ~5000 rupees + 2 working days you get the report that needs to be submitted at <https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/>.


TRANSCRIPTS
------
- When to submit transcripts?
> It’s okay to submit in person after you arrive.

INTERNSHIP
------
- Career fair frequency?
> ~4 fairs seen by Fall’18 batch from sept 18 to mar 19. See <https://careers.ucsc.edu/>

- How big was the career fair at UCSC?
> The career fair targets undergrad(internship and fulltime) and grads equally. So not all companies coming are looking to hire you. The usual size of around 20 companies. The fair lasts for 5-6 hours and talk to someone from the company give your resume and hope for a call in the next week. Noteable ones are Nvidia, Facebook, Arista. (More details about the company at <https://careers.ucsc.edu/student/events-workshops/Job%20Fairs/index.html>)

- When to start internship hunt? 
> As soon as you land. Or maybe before.

- How hard is the job hunt? 
> Depends on your profile. Your skillset match commends interview calls. However, if you apply in the company site maybe its just luck.

- How is the ALUMNI Network?
> Frankly Poor. But you can network / find them on Linkedin and InMail them.

- How is the Interview process for UCSC grads?
> The usual. Unlike grads from top tier colleges like CMU that directly get an interview call, UCSC grads mostly go through an online coding callenge (Mostly Hackerrank). Internships are easier to get compared to full time. Maybe 3-4 times easier. 


RESEARCH
------
- Find advisor (Ph.D)?
> If you joined with an advisor already in your mind (who most likely interviewed you), your Prof. probably mailed you about how he/she plans to onboard you. If you don't have anyone in your mind, you will have enough time to network in the first 2 quarters and join a lab group.

- Find advisor (Masters)?
> Master's students will need advisors for advising their Master's project or thesis. Depending on the Professor, you will be expected to commit for 2-3 quarters and deliver something to the lab or Prof's work. This contribution will decide your CMPS296/CMPS299 course grade.


INSURANCE
------
- Should you take college insurance (UCSHIP)? 
> Depends on how much you want to risk. UCSHIP premium is ~1500$ per quarter. Priviate insurance like (<https://www.psiservice.com/>) and (<https://www.isoa.org/>) is ~400$ per quarter. If you are hired by TA the college provides free insurance. Know enough about US healthcare system before making this decision. 

- How to waive insurance? 
> <https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/billing-insurance/faqs/insurance_waiver/>


FINANCES
------
- What is the cost of my MS at UCSC?
> Too broad. Lets take 4 different situations of how your quarter can be.

- I do not have enough funds yet to show to the college in order to get my i20 because my Education Loan is yet to get sanctioned. What do I do?
> This deadlock is not uncommon. **Solution:** Assuming you will need to show 45-50 lakhs as proof and you have 20 lakhs from family funds as liquid assets and you plan to take 25+ lakhs as a loan, for now you need to get a bank statement from one of ur relatives/friends. You then need to fill a form called affidavit of financial support from isss and ask them to sign it and say your parents + that relative/friend is funding you. Once you get your i20, show that to your bank and get your loan approved.

| Quarter        | Expense($):Fee + Insurance    | Living($) | Income from grading or TAing | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|-----:|
| Q1:Fall     | -9500 -400 (3rd party insurance) | -3000 | +500 (Grader for 1 course) |
| Q2:Winter     | -9500 -1500 (UCSHIP) | -3000 | +1000(Grader for 2 course) |
| Q3:Spring | -5500 (after fee waiver) | -3000 | +6000 (TA for one course) |
 Q4:Summer |  0 |    -4500 (bay area cost) | +15000 (internship salary) | 

- Average rent in Santa Cruz as of 2018-19? 
> 800$/month.
> Guys looking for housing at $650-$700 housing can contact me. I might have a spot of 2 from vacating seniors next year.

-Average cost of internet? 
> $50-$60/month per house

- What about SIM cards/cellphones? 
1. Along with your i20 courier, you receive a starter SIM called J1 sim (<https://www.j1simcards.com/>) that you can activate for $25 plan. **Feedback:** The J1's network is really bad on campus. There are certain areas within campus (around Porter/Rachel Carson college) where all networks lose data coverage though.
2. The alternative: $20-$25/month for a 2GB plan by standard providers like At&T, Verizon is the standard. 2GB will suffice given you would have wifi at home and college. A family plan with your roommates will bring cost down to $20.
3. **Best deal**(after lot of research): I use a $15/month plan with Mint mobile. The network is very good for the price you pay. I recommend that to you. Please use my referral if you plan on buying Mint <http://fbuy.me/lDgC0>

- What is the cost of living? 
> Depends on your diet and lifestyle. How often do you eat outside? You will mostly spend $10-15 per meal per person. Even if you are a non-vegetarian you will mostly spend less than $50 a week on necessities. 

- How hard is it to find housing in Santa Cruz?
> Medium to Hard. 

- Where do I look for housing?
> Your options,
1. Network with previous batch to find who is graduating and if they have a spot

- Teaching assistantship?
> Again you will get explicit instructions a month or 2 before the quarter begins about how and where to apply.

- Other jobs? 
> Tutor/reader on campus is easy. You will never have to work at a McD.

> Walk upto Chase,Mission St, or Wells Fargo,River St or BoA and it should be done in 15 minutes. Call to schedule an appointment for even faster turn around. 

- ATM?
> Best place is at the college near BayTree bookstore. You would need cash only if you are traveling by metro (bus) to the bay area. Cards almost always.

SHOPPING
------
- Groceries?

- Utensils?
> If you already have utensils back home and you have space in your bag, bring them. Otherwise purchases on Amazon or the nearest Indian store at San Jose is wiser.
