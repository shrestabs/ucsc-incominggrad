Congratulation  to all graduate students (M.S, Ph.D.) for receiving an admit from University of California, Santa Cruz. I intend to document some of the common questions that is likely to arise from the day you get an admit to days well into the 2 quarters of your graduate studies. I write this from an Indian/CS or CE student prespective though its applicable to all grad students. 

There are no answers that will help compare your admits. Post in whatsapp/facebook groups or talk to the previous batch grads for opinions on the same. However my take on the pros and cons of UCSC are,

UCSC Strengths
------
* Strong research. High profile Professors and labs.
* Proximity to bay area.
* Small school. Better visibility.

UCSC Cons
------
* Less number of Career fair.
* No co-op.

RESEARCH
------
- Find advisor (Ph.D)?
> If you joined with an advisor already in your mind (who most likely interviewed you), your Prof. probably mailed you about how he/she plans to onboard you. If you don't have anyone in your mind, you will have enough time to network in the first 2 quarters and join a lab group.
