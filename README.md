Congratulation  to all graduate students (M.S, Ph.D.) for receiving an admit from University of California, Santa Cruz. I intend to document some of the common Q&As that is likely to arise from the day you get an admit to days well into the 2 quarters of your graduate studies. I write this from an Indian/CS/CE student prespective though its applicable to all grad students. 

There are no answers that will help compare your admits. Post in whatsapp/facebook groups or talk to the previous batch grads for opinions on the same. However my take on the pros and cons of UCSC are,

UCSC Strengths
------
* Strong research. High profile Professors and labs.
* Proximity to bay area.
* Small school. Better visibility.
* Funding likely with TA.

UCSC Cons
------
* Less number of Career fair.
* No co-op.
* No spring intake.

Getting started
------
* Join some of these groups. 
1. Official Group of UCSC Students 
2. UC Santa Cruz Class of 2020 Roommates
3. University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Housing, Sublets & Roommates 
4. UCSC Indian Student Association
5. Join UCSC and Santa Cruz Reddit
6. Allgrads google groups (You will get a link/invite on your non UCSC email)
* Request your i20 from the international student's office (ISSS <https://isss.ucsc.edu>). You would get an email about it. You will pay around 70$ to get the i20 couriered to you. You will need it for your Visa. 
* As an international student Keep track of your financial, logisitic requirements at <https://visadocs.ucsc.edu>
* Keep track of your TODOs at <https://my.ucsc.edu/>
* Find housing, decide courses, visa, tickets etc ... 

COURSES
------
- Choosing courses How to?  
> Know your funding. Know your goal for master’s. Know your degree requirement (<https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering/graduate/degree-requirements-cmps>) Know when and where you want to intern. Plan your time accordingly. You are the best judge.
- How many quarters does it take to finish MS?
> Practically at least 3. At most 6. Average is 4. (Sept Joining Year (to) December Joining Year+1)
- How many courses per quarter? 
> 2 is the usual number of 5 credit courses. 3 is pushing it. 4 is impossible. Alternatively 3 + TAing is impossible. The first quarter is an exception. 3 courses is manageable including CMPS200 as one.
- When to choose courses?
> You will get a mail from the grad advisor (Alicia Haley). Typically 45 days before beginning of quarter.
- When to take CMPS200/CMPE200? 
> Should be taken in the 1st quarter. See requirements.
- Can CMPE202 Requirement be waived (CS grads only)?
> Yes. With an oral test with one of the CMPE202 Profs. If you failed the test, you need to take the course with Letter grade to get done with the requirement.



GRADES
------
- How important is GPA at UCSC? 
> Until your GPA is > 3.5/4 and you don’t get below B- on 2 courses you are good if your plan is to join the industry. If you intend to pursue a Ph.D a good GPA is necessary. Also, scoring B- on 2 courses will put you on academic probation. Poor Academic Standing for international students can have you deported.

- To take THESIS or PROJECT track(Masters only)?
> You have until the last quarter to decide. You can walk away with any of these choices by enrolling in the courses CMPS(E)296/299 in the graduating quarter. 

VACCINES
------
- How to show proof of immunization? 
> Go to a lab nearby(I went to Dr.Lal PathLabs). Show them the bunch of immunizations proof needed. With 3-4 Blood samples + ~5000 rupees + 2 working days you get the report that needs to be submitted at <https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/>.


TRANSCRIPTS
------
- When to submit transcripts?
> It’s okay to submit in person after you arrive.

INTERNSHIP
------
- Career fair frequency?
> ~4 fairs seen by Fall’18 batch from sept 18 to mar 19. See <https://careers.ucsc.edu/>

- When to start internship hunt? 
> As soon as you land. Or maybe before.

- How hard is the job hunt? 
> Depends on your profile. Your skillset match commends interview calls. However, if you apply in the company site maybe its just luck.

- How is the ALUMNI Network?
> Frankly Poor. But you can network / find them on Linkedin and InMail them.

- How is the Interview process for UCSC grads?
> The usual. Unlike grads from top tier colleges like CMU that directly get an interview call, UCSC grads mostly go through an online coding callenge (Mostly Hackerrank). Internships are easier to get compared to full time. Maybe 3-4 times easier. 


RESEARCH
------
- Find advisor (Ph.D)?
> If you joined with an advisor already in your mind (who most likely interviewed you), your Prof. probably mailed you about how he/she plans to onboard you. If you don't have anyone in your mind, you will have enough time to network in the first 2 quarters and join a lab group.

- Find advisor (Masters)?
> Master's students will need advisors for advising their Master's project or thesis. Depending on the Professor, you will be expected to commit for 2-3 quarters and deliver something to the lab or Prof's work. This contribution will decide your CMPS296/CMPS299 course grade.


INSURANCE
------
- Should you take college insurance (UCSHIP)? 
> Depends on how much you want to risk. UCSHIP premium is ~1500$ per quarter. Priviate insurance like (<https://www.psiservice.com/>) and (<https://www.isoa.org/>) is ~400$ per quarter. If you are hired by TA the college provides free insurance. Know enough about US healthcare system before making this decision. 

- How to waive insurance?
